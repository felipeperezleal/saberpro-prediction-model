# saberpro-prediction-model

# Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict students' performance categories (Baja, Media-baja, Media-alta, Alta) based on various academic and socio-economic variables.

# Dataset:
The dataset used for training and testing the model is provided by Kaggle. It includes features such as student ID, academic information, socio-economic data, and the target variable (RENDIMIENTO_GLOBAL).

Project Structure:

- Data Importation: Loading the necessary libraries and importing the dataset.
- Data Cleaning: Cleaning the dataset to handle missing values, duplicates, and other inconsistencies.
- Data Exploration: Exploring the dataset to understand its structure, distribution, and relationships between variables.
- Modeling: Selecting and training machine learning models to predict students' performance categories.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the models' hyperparameters to improve performance.
- Performance Evaluation: Evaluating the final model's performance using relevant metrics and cross-validation techniques.
- Conclusion and Results: Analyzing the results obtained from the model and drawing insights from the data and predictions.
- Submission File Generation: Structuring the submission dataframe according to the Kaggle competition requirements and exporting it to a CSV file.

Note: This project is part of a competition on Kaggle, where the model's performance will be evaluated based on its accuracy in predicting students' performance categories.
